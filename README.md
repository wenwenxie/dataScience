### Natural Language Processing and Topic Modeling on IMDB Movie Dataset
* Clustered unlabeled movie titles and synopses into groups and discovered latent semantic structures using Python.
* Preprocessed text by tokenizing, stemming and stop words removing using function from NLTK library.
* Extracted features by term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) approach.
* Trained unsupervised learning model of K-Means clustering and LDA.
* Identified latent topics and keywords of each document for clustering and calculated document similarity.
* Visualized model training results by dimensionality reduction using Principal Component Analysis.
### Stock Prices and Market Index Prediction Using Machine Learning and Deep Learning
* Analyzed the volatility feature of Google stock price and market index.
* Used Moving Average, Linear Regression, KNN Regressor to predict the stock price; Calculated RMSE and
visualized the predicted values VS. actual values.
* Built Time Series model Auto ARIMA and Facebook Prophet to infer stock pattern; Calculated RMSE and
plotted the results.
* Implemented deep learning model LSTM to perform stock prediction via TensorFlow on GPU;
* Changed activation and regularization functions; Tuned parameters such as the number of LSTM layers, adding
dropout value, and increasing the number of epochs to achieve a loss of 0.0038.
### YouTube Video Comments Analysis in Apache Spark
* Explored and analyzed the raw data using Spark RDD, Dataframe and PySpark SQL; Labeled the data to
identify the dog/cat owners.
* Built data processing pipeline of RegexTokenizer, Word2Vec to produce user comment vector as features.
* Trained ML models Logistic Regression, Random Forest, GDBT to predict user labels; Used ParamGrid and
K-fold cross validation to tune hyper parameters and choose the best model with ROC 0.958.
* Implemented IDF and LDA model to identify the most important topics among dog/cat owners to recommend
relevant videos; Found video creators with highest percentage of cat/dog owner audience and recommend similar
channels.
### Customer Churn Prediction in Telecommunication Industry
* Developed algorithms for telecommunications service vendors to predict customer churn probability based on
labeled data via Python programming.
* Preprocessed data set by data cleaning, categorical feature transformation and standardization.
* Trained supervised machine learning models including Logistic Regression, Random Forest and K- Nearest
Neighbors; Evaluated mode performance of classification via K-fold cross validation technique.
* Applied regularization with optimal parameters to achieve precision 0.947 and recall 0.723.
* Analyzed feature importance to identify the top factors that influenced the results.
